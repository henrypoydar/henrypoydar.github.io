Hi there!

I'm **Henry Poydar**. I've been messing around with tech all my life and earning a living in web software development since the mid-90s.

I run a small software engineering firm called [8012 Labs](https://8012labs.com), where we build tools intended to simplify and automate conventional processes. That's what computers and robots are for, after all.

I also experiment with the intersection of technology and art, through, well, making art with technology. I'm especially interested in robotics and machine learning, but the ultimate goal is to produce fine art that I'm okay with hanging up. I post my slow progress in this endeavor to my [Instagram feed](https://instagram.com/henrypoydar).

Look me up and reach me directly via the channels below.

Cheers,
